## Brainstorming ##

First off, nice to meet you all. So beside that fact that the most of us are here cause of tom, we should take english as official communication lang.
Overall we need some point to start and i want to start with a Idea:

I think we should take a list with some skillz that everybody has.
And also we should take a brainstorm with ideas about the genre and so on. 

So ill start with a example template modify it if you have upgrades. So dont forget its a democratic process so vote! =) 
Lets do a nice game!
